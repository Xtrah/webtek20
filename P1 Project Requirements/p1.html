                    information about the company and the product. More specific, these customers range from 
                    national car distributors, dealership groups and smaller stand-alone dealers.

                    curious. However, the main target audience are potential customers.

                    Images will show a lot of the concept and will be helpful to understand the product. In
                    addition, short and general descriptions should help spark an interest.
