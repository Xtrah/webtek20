                <strong>
                    The main goal of this web site is to make potential customers of our client interested enough to make contact
                    and ask for a meeting. <br>
                    Main target audience are potential customers of the clients product.
                </strong>

                <p>
                    Website visitors will primarily be potential customers of the company seeking more
                    information about the company and the product. More specific, these customers range from 
                    national car importers and distributers, dealership groups and smaller stand-alone dealers.
                    They can be expected to have at least a basic understanding of the product before arriving on the page. 
                    Other users may be potential investors or people who have heard about the product/company and are just
                    curious. However, the main target audience are potential customers.
                    <br><br>
                <em>
                    We plan to deliver on these goals in making the site informative, and present the product 
                    our client is selling through different images showing the software in use, text to support what the 
                    images is telling. Google maps integration to show the locations of where the product is 
                    installed at existing customers, allowing a potential customer to locate a shop or showroom and enabeling the customer to physically 
                    interact with the product. This will deliver both our client, and their customers an 
                    added benefit and allows the customer to interact with the system in a live environment at their own, pace.
                    Together, these elements will give the web site visitors a firm understanding of the benefits and potential 
                    of using the product.

                    and ask for a meeting."</strong> <br><br> 
                    We feel that this is best achieved through a simpel and concise website consisting of only one page 
                    that has different sections downward. this is simple and intuitiv for the customer combined with a sticky navbar, 
                    this will give the customer what they were seeking upon visiting the site and hopefully reach out and make contact with out client..
