                    Website visitors will primarily be potential customers of the company seeking more
                    information about the company and the product. More specific, these customers range from car 
                    national distributors and dealership groups and smaller stand-alone dealers.
                    They can be expected to have at least a basic understanding of the product before arriving on the page. 
                    Other users may be potential investors or people who have heard about the product/company and are just
                    curious. However, the main target audience are potential customers.
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    Images will show a lot of the concept and will be helpful to understand the product. In
                    addition, short and general descriptions should help spark an interest.
