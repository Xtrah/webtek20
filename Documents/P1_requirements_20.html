	                The main goal of this web site is to make potential customers of our client interested enough to make contact
	                and ask for a meeting. Main target audience are potential customers of the clients product.
	            </strong>

	            <p>
	            <em>Website visitors will primarily be potential customers of the company seeking more
	                information about the company and the product. More specific, these customers range from 
	                national car importers and distributors, dealership groups and smaller stand-alone dealers.
	                They can be expected to have at least a basic understanding of the product before arriving on the page. 
	                Other users may be potential investors or people who have heard about the product/company and are just
	                curious. However, the main target audience are potential customers.
	                <br><br>
	            </em>
	                We plan to deliver on these goals in making the site informative and present the product 
	                our client is selling through different images showing the software in use with text to support what the 
	                images are telling. Google maps integration to show the locations of where the product is 
                    installed at existing customers shops or showrooms, allowing a potential customer to locate a shop or 
                    showroom and enabling the customer to physically interact with the product. 
                    This will deliver both our client, and their customers, an added benefit and allows the customer to 
                    interact with the system in a live environment at their own, pace.
	                Together, these elements will give the web site visitors a firm understanding of the benefits and potential 
	                of using the product.

	                We feel that this is best achieved through a simple and concise website consisting of only one page 
	                with has different sections scrolling down. This is simple and intuitive for the customer combined with a sticky navigation bar, 
	                which will give the customer what they were seeking upon visiting the site and hopefully reach out and make contact with our client.

                    Since we all are fairly new to website production, we are not quite sure what difficulties we might encounter. 
                    Albeit, Google maps integration is new to us all, and we hope to deliver on this, 
                    since we feel this gives an added value to both the customer and our client.
