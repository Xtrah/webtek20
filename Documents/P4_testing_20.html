                    The goal for testing our website properly is to find potential design flaws and otherwise improving
                    aspects of our site that might be confusing or hard to use. To proceed we created a Google Form
                    that asked testers to enter our website, browse around to get a feel of it, and in the end answer
                    some questions. The questions will ask the user about him or herself, the content, the layout and
                    the general feeling of the website. The form is flexible and can work in any testing scenario as it
                    includes both instructions on testing, a questionnaire, and automatically submits the data to us
                    online.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong>We chose to focus on two methods to test our site:</strong><br>
                    - Using the form as a questionnaire in a one-to-one interview while quietly observing
                    the tester navigating our site, and if needed adding follow up questions to go more in depth.<br>
                    - Sent as a link to remote testers.<br>

                <h2>Testing Audience</h2>
                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>
                    As the main audience of the website itself are potential customers of the product, it might be
                    natural
                    to reach out to similar users in the testing phase. It is however hard as student web developers to
                    find and reach out to national car importers and car distributors, so we will instead focus on the
                    general
                    usability of the site for the average user browsing the web sorted by age and occupation. We assume
                    that users within the target industry and the average web user are similar and will be
                    sufficient for testing usability and feeling of the website. The website is designed to work for
                    any web user that has an interest in the product or company and testing will provide data on whether
                    or not the design is working as intended and the user is provided with the information we want.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The testers are a mix of:</strong><br>
                    - Students<br>
                    - Our client<br>
                    - Other average web users<br>
                </p>
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>
                    The test results show that we are partly successful finding the ideal testing audience. We had hoped
                    to reach out to a higher percentage of average web users instead of students, as the majority of
                    student testers are IT students and could be considered a power-user on the web rather than the
                    average user. The testing audience as a whole however is still sufficient to identify potential
                    flaws in our design as well as issues that we would resolve in a future version of the page.

                <h3>Age</h3>
                <p>The age group ranged from 18 to 50+. Ages 18 to 29 was definelty overrepresented. This was mainly due to challenges getting a more widespread group of testers.
                </p>
                <h3>Colors</h3>
                <p>
                        The scale went from "ugly" to "pretty" with a rating of 1 to 6. 
                        48% of the testers liked the choice of colors (rating: 5-6), 36% were close to neutral (rating: 3-4), whilst 26% didn't like it (rating: 1-2). 
                        On average the group 18-50+ rated the colors 3.6, whilst the younger (18-29) rated it 4.08.
                </p>
                <h3>Company</h3>
                <p>
                        7 of the 25 that answered did not remeber the company name.
                        5 of the 25 misunderstood completly or did not remember what the company was trying to sell.
                        Additionally, 7 testers thought that the company was selling cars.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Structure
                </h3>
                <p>
                        The average rating was 4.22 accross all groups.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Navigation
                </h3>
                <p>
                        Average rating: 4.4 <br>
                        Among younger: 4.5 <br>
                        Among older: 4.1 <br>
                        We expected the younger to give a better rating as they are genereally more adaptable to new concepts and ideas. 
                </p>

                    Amount of text
                </h3>
                <p>
                        The average was 2.88 which is close to a perfect score as 1 represents to little and 6, too much. Both younger and older felt the same way. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Trouble

                <p>
                        14 people reported problems with the visit. 
                        Some reported long loading times, which we did excpect as the website contains a big video and multiple pictures.
                        Many of those on tablet and phones experienced trouble. This was also expected because of problems with safari and firefox. This is especially true for safari on mobile.

                <h2>Our Response</h2>
                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>
                    Although we only had 25 participants (less than we would like), we did get alot of usefull responses. The responses have given us a general direction for for us to follow in future development. The following parts of this section will in sum be our response to the feedback that we got from our google form.
                </p>
                <h3>What we did right</h3>
                <p>
                    We experienced positive feedback with the colors, the structure and the navigation. Structurally we felt pleased with the result and were happy that the users felt the same way. The choice of colors was more of a gamble as darker themes on websites rarely come as a standard, but more often an additional feature through a toggle or option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to navigation we were also pleased. As a one-page website the only way for the user to get lost is a near indefinite scroll that makes the user feel lost in a "hole". As we included a navbar we always made sure that the user could navigate wherever, whenever he or she wants to. Moreover, the fact that the pages is quite short, gives the users more sense of control. This was reflected in good scores.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <h3>What we did wrong</h3>
                <p>
                        Although we got a postitive feedback on the colors, we have also noted that some testers disliked the darker theme and would haved preferred it being lighter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Otherwise there were few esctetic complaints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Problems with usability is still an issue. On other browsers than chrome, we had trouble with scaling, dissapearing and functionality, and as mentioned earlier, this was especially true for the mobile version of safari. This is reflected in the statistics from the form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something to note on the issues we had is that we were very limited in terms of libraries and external resources. This has been a part of the reason why we did not get everything right on the other browsers. <b>It was also not a requirement to test in other browsers than chrome.</b> 
                </p>
                <h3>The future of the site</h3>
                <p>
                    If the client wishes to use the website there is much to do. Implementation of databases, updating outdated practices (that we were forced to use due to limitations with libraries) and preening of mobile/tablet versions are some of the most pressing when it comes to usability, functionality and modularity.
