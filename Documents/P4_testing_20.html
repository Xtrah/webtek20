                    The goal for testing our website properly is to find potential design flaws and otherwise improving
                    aspects of our site that might be confusing or hard to use. To proceed we created a Google Form
                    that asked testers to enter our website, browse around to get a feel of it, and in the end answer
                    some questions. The questions will ask the user about him or herself, the content, the layout and
                    the general feeling of the website. The form is flexible and can work in any testing scenario as it
                    includes both instructions on testing, a questionnaire, and automatically submits the data to us
                    online.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong>We chose to focus on two methods to test our site:</strong><br>
                    - Using the form as a questionnaire in a one-to-one interview while quietly observing
                    the tester navigating our site, and if needed adding follow up questions to go more in depth.<br>
                    - Sent as a link to remote testers.<br>

                <h2>Testing Audience</h2>
                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>
                    As the main audience of the website itself are potential customers of the product, it might be
                    natural
                    to reach out to similar users in the testing phase. It is however hard as student web developers to
                    find and reach out to national car importers and car distributors, so we will instead focus on the
                    general
                    usability of the site for the average user browsing the web sorted by age and occupation. We assume
                    that users within the target industry and the average web user are similar and will be
                    sufficient for testing usability and feeling of the website. The website is designed to work for
                    any web user that has an interest in the product or company and testing will provide data on whether
                    or not the design is working as intended and the user is provided with the information we want.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The testers are a mix of:</strong><br>
                    - Students<br>
                    - Our client<br>
                    - Other average web users<br>
                </p>
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>
                    The test results show that we are partly successful finding the ideal testing audience. We had hoped
                    to reach out to a higher percentage of average web users instead of students, as the majority of
                    student testers are IT students and could be considered a power-user on the web rather than the
                    average user. The testing audience as a whole however is still sufficient to identify potential
                    flaws in our design as well as issues that we would resolve in a future version of the page.

                <p>
                    The website is designed to be responsive on all screen sizes. In the questionnaire we collected data about
                    what device was used while testing.
                </p>
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>
                    56% of testers used a desktop or laptop to test our site (full resolution), while the rest
                    used tablet or mobile resolutions. As per our design all features are compatible on all popular
                    screen resolutions, so all features are a product for testing on any platform. As the site is designed
                    to fullful the project requirement of compatibility for Chromium browsers, several testers using other
                    browsers experienced similar bugs. Unfortunately the testing did not include which browsers were used,
                    which is a major learning point for potential future tests.

                    When we started this project, we had different backgrounds and experiences. Nobody had worked with
                    other people in git. Some of us had produced websites at high school. Firstly, we experienced a true
                    challenge to get the whole team on the same page, generating a common understanding of what we were
                    to deliver to our client. Questions like what we are building, what’s our client’s goal, what’s the
                    purpose of the website, were central. The first few group meetings were all about finding a common
                    ground and understanding of our assignment, our goal, and how to achieve it, while maintaining the
                    potential for all members to learn and develop themselves as web developers.
                    <br><br>
                    Once we started working on P2, we had managed to create a good common ground, and we were
                    experimenting with git, git branches and we had our first pull requests and merge conflicts. We were
                    starting to feel the power of Git and how we could collaborate on a bigger project efficiently with
                    git bash together with GitHub.
                    <br><br>
                    Entering P3, our efforts of building a good git understanding proved worthy. We started to have
                    great respect for the power in git and suddenly couldn’t imagine producing code without it. The
                    project has been a great learning experience and journey for us all. Working together as a group is
                    not easy, there have been different levels of ownership and some have neglected their
                    responsibility, leaving others to do additional work.
                    <br><br>
                    All in all, this has been a learning experience building a solid foundation for the rest of our
                    degree here at NTNU and not just web development. We can see how this can scale in the future and
                    how we later may one day be members of professional coding teams. We much appreciated this
                    opportunity and the course have been a pleasure to attend.
