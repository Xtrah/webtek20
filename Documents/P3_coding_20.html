                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>
                    There are multiple changes to our original plan after starting development. The overall design of the
                    page will stay as planned in <a href="P2_design_20.html">P2 Project Design</a> but the
                    organizational scheme and list of files and folders has some changes which we will explain in detail
                    below.
                </p>
                <h3>Front Page</h3>
                <p>
                    General features:
                    We decided to use a video as a background on our front page. This video is filmed and edited by us. There is not parallax implemented because we wanted a video instead of a background image. There is also no JavaScript implemented because we solved pretty much all our tasks using HTML and CSS. 
                    
                    For desktop and mobile: 
                    We did not display a navburger on this section, but rather just implemented the down-arrow function using HTML and CSS. When the visitor clicks the down-arrow, it transitions down to the What We Offer section, with navbar displayed at the top. The centered text on front page is one h1 and one h3 element, instead of three bullet points. We did this to make our front page look cleaner.
                    
                    We didn´t implement a Contact Us sticky logo, because we tested it, but it didn´t look as good as expected. Then we removed it and continued on with just a link in the navbar for Contact Us. 
                    
                    New features: 
                    We implemented a Preload Screen with the Hassel Software logo doing some fancy animations. We learned ... LIVIA SKRIV HER

                    We also added a dark overlay to the video. We did this to make our caption "pop", and make the front page look cleaner.
                </p>
                <h3>What We Offer</h3>
                <h3>Our Customers</h3>
                <h3>Gallery</h3>
                <h3>Our Business</h3>
                <p>
                    We changed the title from "About Us" to a more professional title, "Our Business". 
                    The font-size of the header was chosen to be similar to the rest of the titles. 
                    The font-size and text-align: justify, on the p-element was also changed to look 
                    more appealing to the visitors of the website. The size of the image was rescaled 
                    to look more fitting besides the p-element.
                    <br><br>
                    We added a media query for scaling which activates when the size of our website reduces 
                    to 768px. The media query does display: none to the image, and makes the p-element 
                    centered to optimize the space of our website. The styling is responsive, and every 
                    element scales to the size of the browser window.
                </p>
                <h3>Contact Us</h3>
                <p>

            <section id="orgScheme">
                <h2>Updated organizational scheme</h2>
                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>Here is our updated organizational scheme. Our original plan to fulfill the requirement for
                    modularity was to import sections using JavaScript. To our surprise however, without using the
                    JavaScript library jQuery, the only method to do this are frames which are obsolete in HTML5, and
                    iframes which are not optimal for our intent. This results in our change which consists of all
                    previous seperate <code>.html</code> files that we planned to import using scripts will be hard
                    coded directly into <code>index.html</code> using seperate branches in git, and merged together in
                    the end.</p>

                <h2>Updated work division table</h2>
                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>Work load on each group member has been changed. Instead of working in seperate HTML documents
                    like originally planned, we have divided it into sections in <code>index.html</code>. That means our
                    work division table has a few changes to represent this. Additionally the deadline for the site to
                    be ready for testing was extended by 1 day to handle unexpected merge conflicts.</p>
                    <p>
                        Changes done to the work division table was a result of inexperience with working together as a team. Our planned work division had to change as we realized our specialities, strengths and weaknesses during the development process. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Lastly we want to emphasize that we put alot of effort into teamwork. Having both regular and spntanious meetings, we made sure to update and guide eachother during the development proccess. In addition we used GIT to create issues and requests for everyone to work on. Our git-repository should be seen as a changelog and will document our work division table.
