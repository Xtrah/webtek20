                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>
                    There are multiple changes to our original plan after starting development. The overall design of
                    the
                    page will stay as planned in <a href="P2_design_20.html">P2 Project Design</a> but the
                    organizational scheme and list of files and folders has some changes which we will explain in detail
                    below.
                </p>
                <h3>Responsive design</h3>
                <p>
                    Tackling the responsiveness needed to serve up a good website was a hard challenge at first. Some of us started designing mobile first, and some forgot. The result was quite interesting, and a wake up call for future projects. Designing for mobile first is essential in production of responsive websites. An example of this was the changes needed in the gallery section, where we first started designing for desktop, and were punished when we moved over to mobile.  

                </p>
                <h3>New features</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Scroll to top:</b><br>
                    A standard is to give the users the possibility to go to the top of the page or the front page
                    by clicking the logo. In our case having a long linear navigation page this proves to be even 
                    more important. Therefore we added a closing bracket, which is a part of the logo "Hassel software" logo to 
                    the sticky navbar.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Preload screen:</b><br> 
                    We implemented a preload screen with the Hassel Software logo originally encountering some issues 
                    with load-time. We attempted to compress images and video and explored how other companies resolved pageloading.
                    There are several solutions by using for example; Plugins, lazy loading and compressing. We explored the 
                    solution of making a loading screen as this will give us learning experience in the following fields: Javascript 
                    load attributes, css keyframe animations and handling how a page loads with injections. After the load 
                    function we trigger the gallery injection and by doing this we insure that it loads correctly in the given 
                    viewport size. By choosing to make a loading screen we risk loosing audience in the process, but the feel of a 
                    well made loading screen can also radiate professionalism. For example done on <a href="https://www.miksmaster.no/">
                    this</a> website.
                </p> 
                <h3>Navbar</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Some of the section names changed. Form "About us" to "Our business". Further down in the Our Customers updated 
                    section this will be adressed.
                </p>
                <h3>Front Page</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>General features:</b><br>
                    We decided to use a video as a background on our front page. This video is filmed and edited by us.
                    There is not parallax implemented because we wanted a video instead of a background image. There is
                    also no JavaScript implemented because we solved pretty much all our tasks using HTML and CSS.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>For desktop and mobile:</b><br>
                    We did not display a navburger on this section, but rather just implemented the down-arrow function
                    using HTML and CSS. When the visitor clicks the down-arrow, it transitions down to the What We Offer
                    section, with navbar displayed at the top. The centered text on front page is one <code>h1</code> and one <code>h3</code>
                    element, instead of three bullet points. We did this to make our front page look cleaner.

                    <br><br>
                    We didn´t implement a Contact Us sticky logo, because we tested it, but it didn´t look as good as
                    expected. Then we removed it and continued on with just a link in the navbar for Contact Us.
                    <br><br>
                    We also added a dark overlay to the video. We did this to make our caption "pop", and make the front
                    page look cleaner.
                </p>
                <h3>What We Offer</h3>
                <p>
                    The What We Offer section is mostly unchanged. The exceptions are font size, general scaling, text content and positioning of the
                    bullet points. The font size and weight was tweaked to be more readable. The custom bullet points were
                    positioned better and the general scaling of elements were tweaked to be more responsive and fill the page better.
                    <br><br>
                    We also filled in example text, instead of using placeholder. By doing this, the website got a professional 
                    and real look. The checks in the bulletpoints were also changed from all black, to the iconic green to apply
                    the general style. 
                </p>
                <h3>Our Customers</h3>
                <p>
                    The Our Customers section remained mainly unchanged with the exception of the line that runs at the
                    top of each testionial box. We decided not to implement the line as it only had an esthetics purpose
                    and required more work than what we felt was worth it.
                    <br><br>
                    In the mockup linked in P2 can you that the navbar displays "Our Custom-" instead of "Our Customers". 
                    This was a text-wrap mistake in Illustrator.
                </p>
                <h3>Gallery</h3>
                <p>
                    In P2 we thought that we wanted a grid-gallery, but when entering P3 and starting to code, 
                    we saw that it created a conflict with our initial goal. Our aim was to create a simple and informative site for our client.
                    A big grid would defeat this purpose both on desktop and mobile. Therefore we opted to only have one image 
                    with buttons for the next and previous image. We feel that our P3 solution meets the demand of our customers 
                    in a simple and informative way. We wanted the ability to let mobile users slide/swipe images left and right, 
                    but this proved to be more time consuming then we expected, and to complete the project, we chose to not implement this feature. 
                    We feel that we still reach our over all goal of the image gallery, by only offering the users with clickable buttons.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Business</h3>
                <p>
                    We changed the title from "About Us" to a more professional title, "Our Business".
                    The font-size of the header was chosen to be similar to the rest of the titles.
                    The font-size and <code>text-align: justify</code>, on the p-element was also changed to look
                    more appealing to the visitors of the website. The size of the image was rescaled
                    to look more fitting besides the p-element.
                    <br><br>
                    We added a media query for scaling which activates when the size of our website reduces
                    to 768px. The media query does <code>display: none</code> to the image, and makes the p-element
                    centered to optimize the space of our website. The styling is responsive, and every
                    element scales to the size of the browser window.
                </p>
                <h3>Contact Us</h3>
                <p>
                    There were not many changes to aply to the Contact Us section. It´s pretty much identical to the mockup, but 
                    there is three things we changed.
                    <br><br>
                    We changed the size of the h1-element to make the header look cleaner and symmetric. The size of the pylon-form 
                    were also scaled to look more centered in this section.
                    We have changed the design of the send button in the form. We did this to make the design more symmetric. 
                    It also worked better with the hover animation, making the button expand in each direction instead of only 
                    to the right.
                    <br> <br>
                    We also added some frontend validation to the form. This makes sure that the user writes a name, a (phone)number and an email (something including a "@"). 
                </p>
                <h3>Changes to CSS styling</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Navbar: </b>Added underline animation on hover.<br><br>
                    We chose to have separate stylesheets for every section and imported all css stylesheets to main.
                </p>
                <h3>Javascript additions</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Note about modules: </b>We chose to implement modules to learn about how these work and how you can import functions to
                    other modules with javaScript. We know this is not supported in most browsers yet, but we chose to implement it anyway because
                    we wanted to have different functions in several javaScript files instead of one entire. We do see that this might be a bit verbose.<br><br> 
                    <b>loadingScreen.js: </b>Created loading function to resolve slight loading time issues. This is also to radiate professionalism. This also works as a module to call functions that need to be called after load so that responsiveness
                    of injected elements work better<br><br>
                    <b>navBurger.js: </b>The navBurger javaScript toggles and adds animation to the navigation bar elements. It also toggles the navBurger mobile resolution. This is also one of the modules called in loadingScreen.js<br><br>
                    <b>gallery.js: </b>The gallery is injected to fulfill the responsivity requirement. The javaScript function will listen
                    to viewport sizes and make the gallery slide work through that. This is also one of the modules called in loadingScreen.js<br><br>
                    <b>contactUs.js: </b>The form is not implemented with JavaScript. Though part of the validation is checked for experimental reasons in contacUs.js so that testers can get validation and an alert when the form is theoretically sent. Also the form clears by being reset wich also gives a professional feel.<br><br>
                    <b>footer.js: </b>To fulfill the modularity requirement we inject the footer element. Since we have a linear one-page website
                    this functionality cannot be seen as a whole. Though if the website had several pages this would be modular. 
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="orgScheme">
                <h2>Updated organizational scheme</h2>
                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>This is our updated organizational scheme. Our original plan to fulfill the requirement for
                    modularity was to import sections using JavaScript. To our surprise however, without using the
                    JavaScript library jQuery, the only method to do this are frames which are obsolete in HTML5, and
                    iframes which are not optimal for our intent. This results in our change which consists of all
                    previous seperate <code>.html</code> files that we planned to import using scripts will be hard
                    coded directly into <code>index.html</code> using seperate branches in git, and merged together in
                    the end.</p>

                <h2>Updated work division table</h2>
                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>Work load on each group member has been changed. Instead of working in seperate HTML documents
                    like originally planned, we have divided it into sections in <code>index.html</code>. That means our
                    work division table has a few changes to represent this. Additionally the deadline for the site to
                    be ready for testing was extended by 1 day to handle unexpected merge conflicts.</p>
                <p>
                    Changes done to the work division table was a result of inexperience with working together as a
                    team. Our planned work division had to change as we realized our specialities, strengths and
                    weaknesses during the development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly we want to emphasize that we put alot of effort into teamwork. Having both regular and
                    spntanious meetings, we made sure to update and guide eachother during the development proccess. In
                    addition we used GIT to create issues and requests for everyone to work on. Our git-repository
                    should be seen as a changelog and will document our work division table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also for every section there is a stylesheet that has been imported into the main stylesheet. The
                    same people working with the sections have made the corresponding stylesheets.
