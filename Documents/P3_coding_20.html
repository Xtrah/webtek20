                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>
                    There are multiple changes to our original plan after starting development. The overall design of
                    the
                    page will stay as planned in <a href="P2_design_20.html">P2 Project Design</a> but the
                    organizational scheme and list of files and folders has some changes which we will explain in detail
                    below.
                </p>
                <h3>Front Page</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>General features:</b><br>
                    We decided to use a video as a background on our front page. This video is filmed and edited by us.
                    There is not parallax implemented because we wanted a video instead of a background image. There is
                    also no JavaScript implemented because we solved pretty much all our tasks using HTML and CSS.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>For desktop and mobile:</b><br>
                    We did not display a navburger on this section, but rather just implemented the down-arrow function
                    using HTML and CSS. When the visitor clicks the down-arrow, it transitions down to the What We Offer
                    section, with navbar displayed at the top. The centered text on front page is one <code>h1</code> and one <code>h3</code>
                    element, instead of three bullet points. We did this to make our front page look cleaner.

                    <br><br>
                    We didn´t implement a Contact Us sticky logo, because we tested it, but it didn´t look as good as
                    expected. Then we removed it and continued on with just a link in the navbar for Contact Us.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>New features:</b><br>
                    We implemented a Preload Screen with the Hassel Software logo doing some fancy animations. We
                    learned ... <strong>LIVIA SKRIV HER</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    We also added a dark overlay to the video. We did this to make our caption "pop", and make the front
                    page look cleaner.
                </p>
                <h3>What We Offer</h3>
                <p>
                    It´s pretty much identical to our mockup. It´s only rescaled for propper visuals. We reduced our 
                    font-weight amount... <strong>LIVIA SKRIV HER</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The h3-element isn´t as bold as the mockup, because it looked clean when we med them slim. We did 
                    fill in text for the company, instead of using "lorem". By doing this, the website got a professional 
                    and real look. The bulletpoints were also changed from all black, to black and green. We did this 
                    because we wanted the bulletpoints to look better and "pop".
                </p>
                <h3>Our Customers</h3>
                <p>
                    The Our Customers section remained mainly unchanged with the exception of the line that runs at the
                    top of each testionial box. We decided not to implement the line as it only had an esthetics purpose
                    and required more work than what we felt was worth it.
                    <br><br>
                    In the mockup linked in P2 can you that the navbar displays "Our Custom-" instead of "Our Customers". 
                    This was a text-wrap mistake in Illustrator.
                </p>
                <h3>Gallery</h3>
                <p>
                    In P2 we thought that we wanted a grid-gallery, but when entering P3 and starting to code, 
                    we saw that it created a conflict with our initial goal. Our aim was to create a simple and informative site for our client.
                    A big grid would defeat this purpose both on desktop and mobile. Therefore we opted to only have one image 
                    with buttons for the next and previous image. We feel that our P3 solution meets the demand of our customers 
                    in a simple and informative way. 
                </p>
                <h3>Our Business</h3>
                <p>
                    We changed the title from "About Us" to a more professional title, "Our Business".
                    The font-size of the header was chosen to be similar to the rest of the titles.
                    The font-size and <code>text-align: justify</code>, on the p-element was also changed to look
                    more appealing to the visitors of the website. The size of the image was rescaled
                    to look more fitting besides the p-element.
                    <br><br>
                    We added a media query for scaling which activates when the size of our website reduces
                    to 768px. The media query does <code>display: none</code> to the image, and makes the p-element
                    centered to optimize the space of our website. The styling is responsive, and every
                    element scales to the size of the browser window.
                </p>
                <h3>Contact Us</h3>
                <p>
                    There were not many changes to aply to the Contact Us section. It´s pretty much identical to the mockup, but 
                    there is three things we changed.
                    <br><br>
                    We changed the size of the h1-element to make the header look cleaner and symmetric. The size of the pylon-form 
                    were also scaled to look more centered in this section.
                    We have changed the design of the send button in the form. We did this to make the design more symmetric. 
                    It also worked better with the hover animation, making the button expand in each direction instead of only 
                    to the right.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="orgScheme">
                <h2>Updated organizational scheme</h2>
                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>This is our updated organizational scheme. Our original plan to fulfill the requirement for
                    modularity was to import sections using JavaScript. To our surprise however, without using the
                    JavaScript library jQuery, the only method to do this are frames which are obsolete in HTML5, and
                    iframes which are not optimal for our intent. This results in our change which consists of all
                    previous seperate <code>.html</code> files that we planned to import using scripts will be hard
                    coded directly into <code>index.html</code> using seperate branches in git, and merged together in
                    the end.</p>

                <p>Work load on each group member has been changed. Instead of working in seperate HTML documents
                    like originally planned, we have divided it into sections in <code>index.html</code>. That means our
                    work division table has a few changes to represent this. Additionally the deadline for the site to
                    be ready for testing was extended by 1 day to handle unexpected merge conflicts.</p>
                <p>
                    Changes done to the work division table was a result of inexperience with working together as a
                    team. Our planned work division had to change as we realized our specialities, strengths and
                    weaknesses during the development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly we want to emphasize that we put alot of effort into teamwork. Having both regular and
                    spntanious meetings, we made sure to update and guide eachother during the development proccess. In
                    addition we used GIT to create issues and requests for everyone to work on. Our git-repository
                    should be seen as a changelog and will document our work division table.
