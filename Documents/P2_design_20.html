                        The main goal of this web site is to make potential customers of our client interested enough to make contact
                        and ask for a meeting. Main target audience are potential customers of the clients product.

                    <p>
                    <em>Website visitors will primarily be potential customers of the company seeking more
                        information about the company and the product. More specific, these customers range from 
                        national car importers and distributors, dealership groups and smaller stand-alone dealers.
                        They can be expected to have at least a basic understanding of the product before arriving on the page. 
                        Other users may be potential investors or people who have heard about the product/company and are just
                        curious. However, the main target audience are potential customers.

                    </em>
                        We plan to deliver on these goals in making the site informative and present the product 
                        our client is selling through different images showing the software in use with text to support what the 
                        images are telling. Google maps integration to show the locations of where the product is 
                        installed at existing customers shops or showrooms, allowing a potential customer to locate a shop or 
                        showroom and enabling the customer to physically interact with the product. 
                        This will deliver both our client, and their customers, an added benefit and allows the customer to 
                        interact with the system in a live environment at their own, pace.
                        Together, these elements will give the web site visitors a firm understanding of the benefits and potential 
                        of using the product.

                        We feel that this is best achieved through a simple and concise website consisting of only one page 
                        with has different sections scrolling down. This is simple and intuitive for the customer combined with a sticky navigation bar, 
                        which will give the customer what they were seeking upon visiting the site and hopefully reach out and make contact with our client.
