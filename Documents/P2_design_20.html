                <p>
                    The navigation structure of our website can be described as an all in one page for our client and their products. 
                    Our client wanted to do it this way because of ease for the customer. The purpose of linking all 
                    the sections in one page, is to make it easier for the customers of the website to browse freely 
                    through our different services. From all the sections on the website is it possible to access another 
                    one (Shown in figure 1).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We chose a clique structure to give our customers as much freedom as possible within the website.                         
                    On mobile devices and screens lower then 768px, the NAV-bar is accessed by clicking a hamburger 
                    which will open a menu for the customer. On a desktop the NAV-bar is fixed to the top of the websites. 
                    The function of the NAV-bar is to make different anchors for the different sections in the webpage,                     
                    so browsing can be done all in one click and without scrolling.

              <p>
                    The universal design is oriented around making the user interested enough to make contact and ask for a meeting. 
                    The hierarchical structure is organized so that the website is like a modern IKEA store. 
                    The client will be presented with information in the order we want to. 
                    This way we can build a strong sales argument for our client so they are motivated to take action as they 
                    reach the bottom of the website. New users are expected to be to a certain degree familiar with the product beforehand. 
                    Therefore, we focus on making the universal design simple and clean. The navigation bar will be sticky and therefore 
                    make for easy and fast navigation wherever you are on the linear navigation page. It is simply organized in sections. 
                    You can choose if you want to navigate by scrolling or just by using the navbar. The logo is also included in the upper left corner.

                    This page will furfill the goal by making it more accessible to take contact with the client. 
                    Having the contact form on the site instead of just showing an email makes it easier to take contact. 
                    We also made the form simple and short to make it easier.

                        The footer will contain contact information to our client and a copyright icon.
                        We have chosen a footer with contact information because this is in line with the goal of the site.

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The website must contain a photo gallery with images of the product in use. We will use JavaScript to implement the gallery dynamically with the option to expand. The images will be displayed with a dynamic grid structure on desktop. On mobile we will use a vertical slideshow, possibly with swipe gestures for navigation.</li>
                        <li>To make contact between our client and potential customers easy and intuitive, we are planning to use forms. This is implemented using JavaScript. Possible inputs are text, buttons, checkbox and/or email input. The website output will be a simple notification or prompt.</li>
                        <li>The client wants the page to be in English, and if possible an option to switch to Norwegian language. We are planning this as a bonus feature. If we implement this the option will be displayed as a switch in the top right corner and be activated with JavaScript. To change languages in practice we would probably use <code>Display: none;</code> and <code>Display: block;</code>, unless we find more suitable solutions as we explore our options in depth.</li>
                        <li>We want to use a fixed navigation bar on our desktop website with elements pointing to different sections of the page. To link the NAV-headings to the sections we will use anchor points. When clicking on the button, the customer will be taken to the desired section with a smooth scrolling animation. This is to ensure that the user always knows where he/she is located on the page.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Looks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The website must have a professional look and fell which gives the customer faith in the abilities of the company. By this we mean that the website shoule be as bug-free as possible, and that the customer should have an experience that reflects the company's reliability and seriousness.</li>
                    <li>The design should be simplistic, allowing the key selling points and images to speak for themselves. With a simplistic and minimalistic design we draw attention to what the client wants to showcase. It also substantiates the professional look and feel that we are aiming for.</li>
                    <li>The website must showcase the potential of implementing the software solution. In addition we want to show existing implementations that have been adapted by other customers.</li>
                </ul>
