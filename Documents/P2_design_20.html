                    The main goal of this web site is to make potential customers of our client interested enough to make contact
                    and ask for a meeting. Main target audience are potential customers of the clients product.
                </strong>

                <p>
                <em>Website visitors will primarily be potential customers of the company seeking more
                    information about the company and the product. More specific, these customers range from 
                    national car importers and distributors, dealership groups and smaller stand-alone dealers.
                    They can be expected to have at least a basic understanding of the product before arriving on the page. 
                    Other users may be potential investors or people who have heard about the product/company and are just
                    curious. However, the main target audience are potential customers.
                    <br><br>
                </em>
                    We plan to deliver on these goals in making the site informative and present the product 
                    our client is selling through different images showing the software in use with text to support what the 
                    images are telling. Google maps integration to show the locations of where the product is 
                    installed at existing customers shops or showrooms, allowing a potential customer to locate a shop or 
                    showroom and enabling the customer to physically interact with the product. 
                    This will deliver both our client, and their customers, an added benefit and allows the customer to 
                    interact with the system in a live environment at their own, pace.
                    Together, these elements will give the web site visitors a firm understanding of the benefits and potential 
                    of using the product.

                    <strong>"The main goal of this web site is to make potential customers of our client interested enough to make contact
                    and ask for a meeting."</strong> <br><br> 
                    We feel that this is best achieved through a simple and concise website consisting of only one page 
                    with has different sections scrolling down. This is simple and intuitive for the customer combined with a sticky navigation bar, 
                    which will give the customer what they were seeking upon visiting the site and hopefully reach out and make contact with our client.

                <div class="hrReplacement"></div>
                <p>The navigation structure of our website can be described as an all in one page for the product. 
                Our client chose to do it this way because of ease for the customer. The purpose of linking all 
                the sections in one page, is to make it easier for the customers of the website to browse freely 
                through our different services. From all the sections on the website is it possible to access another 
                one (Shown in figure 1).<br><br>
                We chose a clique structure to give our customers as much freedom as possible within the website.                         On mobile devices and smaller screens, the NAV-bar is accessed by clicking an hamburger-menu-icon 
                which will open a menu for the customer. On a desktop the NAV-bar is fixed to the top of the websites. 
                The function of the NAV-bar is to make different anchors for the different sections in the webpage,                     so browsing can be done all in one click and without scrolling.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The website must contain a photo gallery with images of the product in use. We will use JavaScript to implement the gallery dynamically with the option to expand. The images will be displayed with a dynamic grid structure on desktop. On mobile we will use a vertical slideshow, possibly with swipe gestures for navigation.</li>
                        <li>To make contact between our client and potential customers easy and intuitive, we are planning to use forms. This is implemented using JavaScript. Possible inputs are text, buttons, checkbox and/or email input. The website output will be a simple notification or prompt.</li>
                        <li>The client wants the page to be in English, and if possible an option to switch to Norwegian language. We are planning this as a bonus feature. If we implement this the option will be displayed as a switch in the top right corner and be activated with JavaScript. To change languages in practice we would probably use <code>Display: none;</code> and <code>Display: block;</code>, unless we find more suitable solutions as we explore our options in depth.</li>
                        <li>We want to use a fixed navigation bar on our desktop website with elements pointing to different sections of the page. To link the NAV-headings to the sections we will use anchor points. When clicking on the button, the customer will be taken to the desired section with a smooth scrolling animation. This is to ensure that the user always knows where he/she is located on the page.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Looks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The website must have a professional look and fell which gives the customer faith in the abilities of the company. By this we mean that the website shoule be as bug-free as possible, and that the customer should have an experience that reflects the company's reliability and seriousness.</li>
                    <li>The design should be simplistic, allowing the key selling points and images to speak for themselves. With a simplistic and minimalistic design we draw attention to what the client wants to showcase. It also substantiates the professional look and feel that we are aiming for.</li>
                    <li>The website must showcase the potential of implementing the software solution. In addition we want to show existing implementations that have been adapted by other customers.</li>
